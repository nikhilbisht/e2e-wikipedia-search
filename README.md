## Installation
After cloning the project from the repository, make sure you run `npm install` to install all node modules. There should be no further installation required.

## Command to run Test
`npm run test` is the command to run the test

## Project Structure :

1.	fixtures : Fixtures are used as test-data that can be used by test-scripts. I have created 1 fixture file search-text.json, that contains the text to be searched
2.	support :    Support files are in cypress/support.

    - /support/e2e.js.  This file runs before every single spec file. We have imported all the .js file inside the support folder, so we donâ€™t have to import in all the test-scripts.
	- /support/search.js - This file contains all the cypress commands that is required to search the text.
	- /support/result.js - This file contains the code to verify the page after a text is searched

3. e2e : This folder contains all the test-scripts.
